**Cyclops** is a high-power LED driver that enables precise control of light
power for optogenetic stimulation. The circuit was developed by Jon Newman
while in Steve Potter's lab at Georgia Tech in order to complete his thesis
work, which required the delivery of ultra-precise, continuously time-varying
light waveforms for optogenetic stimulation \[1,2\]. This was, and still is,
not possible with commercial hardware for optogenetic stimulation. Since its
first use, the circuit has been improved in terms of speed, precision,
programmability, and ease of use.  This document provides construction, usage,
and performance documentation for the Cyclops LED driver. This document evolves

# Note From the Maintainer

It has been a long road to design and test the Cyclops, coordinate the
acquisition of materials, coordinate the manufacturing processes, and to
distribute the device to the community. This process has been a lot of work but
also a very rewarding learning experience. I am very happy that this
device may enable your scientific endeavors and I'm sincerely grateful
for your interest in the project. In general, I hope this project will
eventually be one small module in a of growing set of __high-quality__,
__open-source__, and __afforable__ tools that facilitate your research and
enable an __open__, __community-oriented__ approach to science.

Profits from the sale of Cyclops kits go to funding the Open Ephys non-profit
organization. Since I receive no monetary compensation from the sale of these
devices, it would mean a great deal to me if you would consider referencing the
following paper (for which the Cyclops was developed) in published work that
makes use of the device.

# Performance Specifications

The following oscilloscope traces give indicates of the circuit's precision and
speed (Rev. 3.5c) . Note that time series traces are **not** averaged - these
traces display per-pulse temporal characteristics. Optical characteristics and
optical feedback signal for the Cyclops driver were provided by a Thorlabs
PDA36 amplified photodiode set to 0 dB of transimpedance gain. Measurements
were performed a single Osram golden dragon LED.

to 750 mV, 10% duty cycle square

![Zoomed traces showing waveform 10-90% rise times. Optical rise time

The following traces are the same as the previous ones except that the
amplified photodiode was used to provide optical feedback. The slowdown
compared to current feedback is due to a speed of the photodiode. A
faster amplified photodiode would provide crisper rise and fall times

The current-feedback mode -3dB bandwidth was determined by applying a
flat noise signal over 50 MHz with mean = 1.0V and Vpp = 500 mV into the
`EXT` port with maximal current gain. It occurs at around 2.5 MHz.

# Usage

![Cyclops physical interface (Rev. 3.6).](./resources/device3.6_io-diagram.png)

The cyclops is a device that is capable of transforming voltage signals (e.g.
sine waves, square pulses, etc.) into optical signals from high-power LEDs.
Voltage signals to drive the device can be generated internally using an
on-board digital to analog converter or can be delivered from an external
source, such as a function generator or stimulus sequencer. The cyclops
provides numerous measurements of circuit operation that can be recorded during
an experiment such as LED current and stimulus reference voltages. The device
can be controlled over a USB interface using its onboard, Arduino-compatible
[Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html#specs) microcontroller
board in combination with the [Cyclops Arduino library](./lib/cyclops/).  The
device also can be configured to drive commercially available LED modules from
Thorlabs and Doric using its expansion ports.

Below we provide an explanation of the operational modes of the device and the
different ways it can be used to generate optical stimuli. Refer to the above
diagram to locate the physical switches, dials, and connectors corresponding to
verbal or iconic descriptions device settings.

## Feedback modes

### Current Feedback Mode

To use current feedback mode, push the `F.B. MODE` slide switch to the `CURR`
position (![Current feedback mode.](./resources/curr_switch_icon.png)). Using
the circuit in current feedback mode ensures that the forward current across
the LED is precisely regulated according the voltage at the `VREF` pin. This
configuration is a standard method for driving LEDs because the relationship
between current and LED irradiance is smooth and monotonic.  This means that
more current across the LED will generate more light power (while staying
within the LED's maximum ratings, of course).  However, the relationship
between current and irradiance is not linear.  For most LEDs, it looks like a
logarithmic function. Additionally, the efficiency of the LED is inversely
related to its temperature. So, as the LED operates and heats up, the amount of
light it produces drops even when the current is held constant. The severity of
an LED's temperature dependence and current/irradiance nonlinearity depend on
the type of LED (roughly, the color and who made it). These properties should
be clearly documented in the LED's data sheet. With a quality LED and proper
thermal management, the effects of temperature and static current/irradiance
nonlinearity are fairly minimal and can be ignored in most situations.

![Current feedback
configuration.](./resources/current_feedback_diagram.png)

### Auxiliary Feedback Mode

To use auxiliary feedback mode, push the F.B. MODE slide switch to the AUX 
position). When extremely stable, linear control of light power is required,
the auxiliary feedback input can be used to used to compensate for the 
temperature dependence and static nonlinearity of the current/irradiance 
relationship of the LED. For example, when the auxiliary voltage is supplied
by an amplified photodiode that is somewhere indecent to radiation from the LED, 
or is sampled from the fiber transporting LED light, the gate voltage is adjusted
such that the measured light power matches a DAC-supplied reference voltage. This
is the case in the circuit diagram. This configuration is referred to as optical
feedback mode.  The PDA36A adjustable amplified photodiode from Thorlabs  is a 
good option for supplying optical feedback. However, you can make your own 
amplified photodiode for a fraction of the price, and a design is included within
the cyclops repository. For directions on how to build your own photodiode, see
later section in manual.  Optical feedback completely linearizes the relationship
between a supplied reference voltage and the light power produced by the LED by 
compensating for the current/irradiance nonlinearities and temperature dependence.
The easiest way to connect the photodiode is through a fiber coupled led (many
different kinds available through ThorLabs) connected to a 1x2 fiber coupler
(something along the lines of this [splitter]
(https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=TM105R2S1A) ) and use an 
opaque epoxy to attach the 10% end of the splitter to the photodiode.

![Optical feedback configuration.](./resources/optical_feedback_diagram.png)

## Bandwidth Selection
The Cyclops can be operated in two bandwidth modes: `FULL` and `LIM`. This
provides user-selectable control over the speed at which the LED can be turned
on/off.

### Full Bandwidth Mode
To operate the device in full bandwidth mode, move the `B.W. SELECT` switch to
the `FULL` position (![Full bandwidth mode.](./resources/full_switch_icon.png)).
When the device is operated at full bandwidth, the user can take advantage very
short turn on/off times (1.0 A in about 100 ns rise/fall times). Additionally,
continuously varying optical signals are accurately represented up to about 2
MHz. That said, Cyclops is a fairly high-power circuit. The currents and
voltage used to drive high power LEDs are many orders of magnitude (like 6 or
more...) greater than those recorded during electrophysiology experiments.
Also, the Cyclops is a fast circuit. Fast circuits hate long cables because
they introduce appreciable delays and parasitics that can adversely affect
operating characteristics. Very long cables will introduce ringing into light
waveforms with fast edges!  Ideally, the LED should be right next to the
device. I typically mount my fiber coupled LEDs directly into the banana
sockets on the back of the device using copper-clad printed circuit board so
that my 'cables' are about 2 cm in length.  In any case, the following is
allways good advice: **keep the cabling to the LED as short as possible and
'fat' enough to handle high currents (AWG 18 or thicker)**.

### Limited Bandwidth Mode
To operate the device in full bandwidth mode, move the `B.W. SELECT` switch to
the `LIM.` position (![Limited bandwidth bandwidth mode.](./resources/lim_switch_icon.png)).
In this mode, the feedback circuit within the cyclops will operate at lower
speeds. This is useful in situations where the use wishes to place the Cyclops
device far away from the LED being driven (e.g. when it is mounted on the head
of an animal rather than light being transmitted via optic fiber).  In this
case, the bandwidth of the device can be lowered to avoid ringing and
instability when a long, potentially thin cable is used. I have driven LEDs at
1.5A over AWG 30 cable that is several meters long without issue in bandwidth
limit mode. This would cause the device to oscillate wildy in full bandwidth
operation. When the device is operated in bandwidth limit mode, the rise and
fall times of LED pulse will increase to about 1.5 microseconds, and the -3 dB
bandwidth will degrade to ~200 kHz or so. This is plenty fast for almost all
neuroscience applications.

## Stimulus Generation Options

There are three ways to generate light signals using the driver. The
behavior of each of these options is dependent on the feedback mode
being used. The behavior of each input option is described in relation
to the feedback mode of the driver.

1.  ![Test button.](./resources/test_button_icon.png) The test button is
    always available and will override all other input modes. Using the
    `TEST` button the behavior of the circuit is:

-   ![Current feedback mode.](./resources/curr_switch_icon.png) Source
    the current specified by the `MAX CURR.` dial.
-   ![Auxilary feedback mode.](./resources/aux_switch_icon.png) Generate
    the optical power specified by the h \* mW level that is specified
    by the `MAX POWER` dial. The intensity of the LED will be dependent
    on the auxiliary feedback signal used which defines the
    'h' parameter.

2.  ![EXT mode.](./resources/ext_toggle_icon.png) External input mode is
    engaged when the `SOURCE` switch is moved to the `EXT` position and
    user supplied voltage waveforms are present at the `EXT` BNC input.
    If the user attempts to supply more than 5V to the `EXT` input, the
    circuit will clamp the input signal to 5V. Using `EXT` mode, the
    behavior of the circuit is:

-   ![Current feedback mode.](./resources/curr_switch_icon.png) Source
    the current specified by (EXT Voltage / 5V) \* MAX CURR.
-   ![Auxilary feedback mode.](./resources/aux_switch_icon.png) Generate
    the optical power specified by (EXT Voltage/5V) \* h \* mW. The
    intensity of the LED will be dependent on the auxiliary feedback
    signal used which defines the 'h' parameter.

3.  ![DAC mode.](./resources/dac_toggle_icon.png) The internal digital
    to analog converter (DAC) is engaged when the `SOURCE` switch is
    moved to the `DAC` position and can be used to generate
    pre-programmed waveforms and waveform sequences triggered by a
    digital pulse to the `TRIG` input. This feature relies on optional
    Arduino installation and programming the device using its API. Using
    the `DAC` mode, the behavior of the circuit is:

-   ![Current feedback mode.](./resources/curr_switch_icon.png) Source
    the current specified by (DAC Voltage / 5V) \* MAX CURR.
-   ![Auxilary feedback mode.](./resources/aux_switch_icon.png) Generate
    the optical power specified by (DAC Voltage/5V) \* h \* mW. The
    intensity of the LED will be dependent on the auxiliary feedback
    signal used which defines the 'h' parameter.

## Using the onboard microcontroller
Cyclops devices include an onboard, Arudino-compatible microcontroller board
(Teensy 3.2) that can:

- Generate custom waveforms
- Respond to trigger input
- Provide background over-current protection

The Teensy can be programmed and uploaded to the device using the [Arduino
IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) in combination with [Cyclops
Arduino library](./lib/cyclops). _Note that you will need to add the
[Teensyduino add-on](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html) to to the
Arduino IDE to program the Teensy_. The Cyclops library contains several
examples to help you get started. The relevant public programming interface is
shown here:

// to 4 stacked Cyclops boards.

    int dac_prog_voltage(const uint16_t voltage) const;

    // Load the DAC output register to affect a voltage change on the output
    // pin. This function affects all running cyclops devices that have had
    // their DAC's programmed using the dac_prog_voltage() function.
    static void dac_load(void);

                               const uint32_t sample_period_us) const;

    // Get an LED current measurement in milliamps
    //    returns: LED current measurement in milliamps.
    inline float measure_current(void) const;

    //               detail.

    // Call this static method after creating all cyclops channels to start the
    // internal overcurent protection engine and waveform generation machinery.
    // This funciton is used to start all channels.
    static void begin(void);

    // *this's channel ID
    const Channel channel;

```

\newpage
A simple example Arduino sketch, which uses the Cyclops to produce a [sinusodal chirp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp), is shown here:

```c++
#include <Cyclops.h>

#define PI_CONST 3.14159265358979323846

// Parameters of the chirp waveform
#define CHIRP_TIME_MS 5000 // Length of chirp waveform in msec
#define FREQ_START 0.5f    // Start frequency in Hz

// Create a single cyclops object. CH0 corresponds to a physical board with
// jumper pads soldered so that OC0, CS0, TRIG0, and A0 are used. Set the
// current limit to 1A on this channel.
Cyclops cyclops0(CH0, 1000);

// Chirp frequency ramp parameter
float beta = 1.0;

void setup()
{
    // Chirp parameter
    beta = (FREQ_END - FREQ_START) / (((float)CHIRP_TIME_MS) / 1000.0);

    // Start the device and zero out its DAC
    Cyclops::begin();
    cyclops0.dac_load_voltage(0);
}

void loop()
{
    // Calculate current chirp amplitude
    float now = ((float)(millis() % CHIRP_TIME_MS)) / 1000.0;
    float freq
        = 2.0 * PI_CONST * (FREQ_START * now + (beta / 2.0) * pow(now, 2));
    unsigned int voltage = (unsigned int)(4095.0 * (sin(freq) / 2.0 + 0.5));

    // Program the DAC and load the voltage
    cyclops0.dac_load_voltage(voltage);

## Components

### PCB
Unpopulated Cyclops PCBs can be fabricated by uploading the [gerber
files](./cyclops/pcb/gerber/) to the PCB fabrication service of your choice. I have
had success with:

-   [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) - made in America, excellent quality.
    Minimum of 3 boards per order
-   [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/index.php?r=pcb) - made
    in China, very good quality. Minimum of 5 boards per order.

![A bare Cyclops PCB, top side, fabricated by Seeed
Studio.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_board1.jpg)

The layer of each gerber file is identified by its file extension:

     *.GKO = board outline
     *.GTS = top solder mask
     *.GBS = bottom solder mask
     *.GTO = top silk screen
     *.GBO = bottom silk screen
     *.GTL = top copper
     *.G2L = inner layer 2 copper
     *.G3L = inner layer 3 copper
     *.GBL = bottom copper
     *.XLN = drill hits and sizes

PCB stencils, which are useful for applying solder paste to the boards, can be
purchased from a service like [Seeed
Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/index.php?r=stencil) using the
gerber files located in [./cyclops/device/stencil/](./cyclops/stencil/). If you
plan to hand solder the board, or don't mind dispensing solder paste yourself,
then you do not need to purchase these stencils.

### TODO: PCB Bill of Materials 
TODO: Google doc update!

Fully assembled cyclops PCBs can be purchased from Circuit Hub [Cyclops on
Circuit Hub](https://circuithub.com/projects/jonnew_/cyclops). This also
includes an up-to-date parts list for each PCB with optimized prices.
*Note that these parts are for a single PCB without the enclosure, power
supply, etc*. Also, this may be out of date. 

EDIT: LINK IS OUT OF DATE

To get the newest version of the bill of materials, download AutoDesk Eagle
and open up the schematic in cyclops-master\device\pcb\cyclops.sch, click
the yellow ULP button and run the bom.ulp file.  You can then save this list
as a text or an XLS file.  

### Other Materials
A complete device requires several additional components aside from the PCB itself. These
pre-populated Digikey cart. These can be found on the [device kit bill of materials] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YQR_ujrZgILNx3XjomLKWgzDvirwKrKaRbVVzmBgk-s/edit#gid=1723140815).

-   An **extruded aluminum enclosure**, which houses the
    completed board. The enclosure is recommended because the large
    voltages and current transients used to drive high power LEDs can
    cause capacitive and inductive interference with nearby
    recording equipment. Acrylic front and rear panels can be purchased
    from Ponoko using the links supplied in the BOM. The instructions
    below show how these plastic pieces are modified to provide proper
    electrical shielding.
-   **Custom heatsink**, a waterjet-cut aluminum heatsink. Designs can be found
    in the [heatsink](heatsink/alu-heatsink.PDF) folder.
-   **Teensy 3.2 MCU**, a 32-bit microcontroller development board. Can be
    purchased [here](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html)
-   An **M8-4 connector** (Optional). This is a rather expensive connector that
    allows cyclops to drive [Thorlabs LED
    modules](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=5206)
    or [Doric LED
    modules](http://doriclenses.com/life-sciences/243-led-modules).

## Board Assembly Manual

### Board Assembly Materials
To assemble a Cyclops board, you will need the following materials

-   A soldering iron and, if possible, a hot-air reflow device.
    -   At minimum, a soldering iron regulated to \~370 deg. c) will do
        the job.
    -   In addition to the iron, a hot-air rework tool or reflow oven
        are recommended and the assembly instructions below assume you
        are using one of these two options. A low cost, high-quality
        hot-air rework station can be purchased from SparkFun
        [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10706).

    ![A soldering iron can be used to assemble the PCB, but a hot air
    rework station makes things much easier. These can be purchased from
    [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10706).](./resources/HeatGun.jpg)

-   Copper braid ('solder wick') for solder removal (e.g
    [this](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9327))
-   Liquid flux (`no-clean` variants are easiest since they don't have

### Board Assembly Instructions
PCB component population and soldering is fairly straightforward and
requires standard surface mount construction techniques.

-   A tutorial on hot-air soldering can be found
    [here](https://youtu.be/1z0IiuQ35HU).
-   A great tutorial filled with general tips and tricks for surface
    mount soldering can be found [here](https://youtu.be/pdGSFc7VjBE).

The following steps provide a visual guide to construct your own board.
The goal is to create a fully populated PCB like this one:

![Finished device (revision 3.3).](./resources/cyclops3.3_both.jpg)

*Following board construction, you should run through the electrical
tests outlined in the next section before applying power.*

1.  Place the bare PCB on a flat surface, preferably one that is static
    dissipative or anti-static. Alternatively, the board can be mounted
    in a PCB vice.

    ![Instead of populating components on a table, holding the PCB using
    a PanaVise can be helpful.](./resources/Station.jpg)

1.  The silkscreen layer on the PCB (white text) has almost all the
    information you will need to properly populated the PCB. However,
    its a good ideal to to open the [cyclops
    design](./cyclops/cyclops_r3.brd) in
    [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/eagle-pcb-design-software/). This
    will allow you to get detailed information on components before
    placing them on the board.

    ![The cyclops PCB design in CadSoft EAGLE](./resources/Eagle.jpg)

    You can then the `information` tool to get detailed information on
    each component, e.g. to ensure you are placing the correct value
    resistor or capacitor.

    ![By selecting the information tool and clicking the cross at the
    center of a component, you can pull up detailed info (e.g.
    part number)](./resources/EagleInfo.jpg)

3.  After cleaning the surface of the board with isopropyl acholhol or
    similar, apply solder paste to each of the pads. For an excellent
    series of tips on effective methods for dispensing solder paste, see
    [Mike's video on the subject](https://youtu.be/pdGSFc7VjBE). Do not
    apply solder paste to through-holes or the pads shown outlined in
    red in the following image. These will be hand soldered later in the
    assembly process.

    The correct amount of solder paste to apply is \`enough'. Each
    component contact should sit in a small amount of paste, but blobs
    of paste that envelop the component pad or pin may later result in
    a short. The following images show examples of good and bad
    solder placement.

    ![Good solder placement.](./resources/SolderGoodExample.jpg)

    ![Bad solder placement. Too much
    paste!](./resources/SolderBadExample.jpg)

    If you need to pause at any point, you should store place the PCB in
    the fridge to prevent the flux in the solder paste from
    breaking down.

4.  Populate all **top-side surface mount** components on the board.
    There is a single surface mount switch on the back of the board that
    will be hand soldered later. Additionally, all through hole
    components (e.g. power jack, BNC connectors, etc) will be
    populated later. Start by placing the integrated circuits (ICs). Use
    the stereoscope or loupe to ensure that pads are making contact with
    the pins of the placed components. Precise component alignment is
    not necessary. Components will self-align during the reflow process.

    ![Integrated circuit population.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_IC.jpg)

    ![Zoomed view of integrated
    circuit placement.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_IC2.jpg)

5.  After placing the ICs, place the passive components (resistors,
    capacitors, inductors, diodes, and ferrite chips).

    ![Board following resistor and
    capacitor population.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_RnC.jpg)

    ![Board with all top-side surface mount
    components installed.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_otherPassives.jpg)

6.  Next, reflow solder the board. We use a homemade reflow oven constructed
    from a toaster oven, Arduino board, [reflow oven control
    shield](http://www.rocketscream.com/shop/reflow-oven-controller-shield-arduino-compatiblee),
    and [mains relay](https://www.adafruit.com/products/268). You can make a
    similar one, use a commercial reflow oven, or use the hot air station.
    Reflow the solder paste on the board using your oven or hot air gun as
    described in the links above.

    ![Homemade reflow oven with the populated
    board inside.](./resources/ReflowOven.jpg)

    ![The board is shown after the reflow temperature has been reached.
    Reflow will occur at different temperatures depending on the
    specification of the solder paste you
    are using.](./resources/ReflowOven4.jpg)

7.  After the solder has cooled, examine solder pads using the
    stereoscope of loupe for solder bridges between pins, solder that
    has not melted, or pads lacking a decent solder joint. Fix any
    issues using a standard soldering iron If there are solder bridges
    present, get rid of them using some solder wick before moving on.
    Solder through-hole components in place using a standard
    soldering iron. A low cost reflow oven can be made from a toaster
    oven as shown [here](http://whizoo.com/reflowoven).

    ![Example of a short between IC pins. This must be resolved before
    moving forward.](./resources/ShortExample.jpg)

    ![Dipping the copper braid in flux will make the solder wick much
    more redily.](./resources/ShortExample2.jpg)

    ![Place the copper braid over the solder blob and then press with
    the soldering iron. You should see the excess solder wick up the
    copper braid.](./resources/ShortExample3.jpg)

    ![Often you will not have to re-apply solder after this process
    because there will be enough left over to maintain a good
    electrical contact. Once you are satisfied the flux residue can be
    cleaned using isopropyl alcohol](./resources/ShortExample4.jpg)

8.  Each board has an address (0 through 3) that is defined by two
    solder jumpers and the location of a ferrite chip. This allows
    cyclops boards to be stacked to share a power supply while being
    driven by a common microcontroller. For each board that will share a
    microcontroller, a unique address must be specified and the solder
    jumpers and ferrite chip must be soldered in appropriate positions
    to reflect this address. See the picture below to better understand
    this addressing scheme.

    TODO: Pictures of circled 0 ohm jumpers

9.  Flip the board over and install the final surface mount component,
    the `AUX<>CURR` and `BW LIM` slide switches, by hand soldering.

10. Next, populate all electromechanical components. This can be
    soldered in place with a standard soldering iron and a large
    chisel tip.

    ![Top side of board following electromechanical
    component installation.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_EM1.jpg)

    ![Bottom side of board following electromechanical
    component installation.](./resources/cyclops3.5A_EM2.jpg)

    **Note:** The the barrel power jack (name: `POWER`, value: PJ-063BH
    on the schematic) should be mounted on the **bottom** of the board.
    It fits on both the top and the bottom, and will properly supply the
    board with power if mounted on the top. However, if the barrel jack
    is mounted on the top side of the board, it will not fit inside
    the enclosure.

11. If you are not planning on putting the PCB in an enclosure, jumper the
    solder points for the power switch together using AWG 20 (\~1.8 mm
    diameter) braided copper wire or thicker.

4. T10 Torx key or driver (#2)
5. XX Allen key or driver (#3)
6. Teensy soldering jig made from breadboard with male headers (#14)


Additionally, to use your device once it is assembled, you will need:

1. An LED to drive [Required]

  - See the [LED section](LED) for options.

1. A power supply [Required]

  - Any wall-wart, battery pack, or bench-top power supply providing 15-20 VDC
    that can source >=2A will work.
  - The power jack is __center positive__ (but reversing this will not ruin the
    device, it just wont turn on).
  - Look around and see if you have a wall-wart laying around the lab that
    meets the specs. They are pretty common and the jack is likely to fit.
  - [Digikey part number
    1470-3096-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en?keywords=1470-3096-ND)
    or equivalent is a good option for those that need to buy a supply.

1. An M8, 4-pin connector [Optional]

  - An inexpensive, standard, non-insane, 2x5 header (`EXPANSION A`) provides
    access to most of the internal signals on the Cyclops board, e.g. for
    driving an LED or providing auxiliary feedback using an amplified
    photodiode etc.
  - An expensive, strange, moderately insane, M8 expansion connector that is
    used by two major companies in the optics space (`EXPANSION B`) is left
    unpopulated. You can populate this port if you wish to drive Thorlabs or
    Doric LED modules using the Cyclops. For instructions, see this the
    complete manual.

### Device Assembly Instructions

1. Assemble the teensy 3.2

    ![Teensy MCU assembly](./resources/teensy-assembly-steps.png)

  - Solder the surface mount, 2x7 pin header to the bottom of the teensy. It is
    important to do this first because its very hard to get to after the other
    headers are installed.
  - Put the single row headers on the soldering jig (panel 2, above), followed by the Teensy (panel 3, above).
    The microcontroller chip should be facing up.
  - Solder the headers in place.

2. Assemble the power switch

    ![Power switch assembly](./resources/switch-solder-steps.jpg)

  - Strip about 1 cm of insulation from each end of the hookup wires
  - Thread the stripped portion of the wire halfway through each of the
    switch's solder terminals. Fold the wire back, so that the stripped part is
    touching both sides of the terminal.
  - Solder the hookup wire to the terminals. Make sure the solder flows between
    the wires' copper braid and the switch terminals.
  - Slide the heat shrink from the back of each wire, over the solder joints.
    Hit then with a hot air gun or pass a lighter underneath them to shrink
    them into place over the solder joints.

3. Prepare the back panel

    ![Power switch installation](./resources/switch-install-steps.jpg)

  - Press the  power switch into position on the back panel. Orient the switch
    so that the 'on' symbol (-) is toward the middle of the panel and the 'off'
    symbol (o) is toward the outside. This will make the panel easier to mount
    on the enclosure.
  - The switch will snap into place.

4. Install the teensy on the cyclops

  - Press the previously assembed teensy onto the 0.1" pitch male headers. It
    should be _upside down_ on the bottom of the cyclops PCB.

5. Put thermally conductive tape on the heatsink

  - Cut a square of thermal tape from the roll
  - Peal off the backing and press the tape on the back of the heatsink.
  - Poke holes through the tape to expose the bolt holes in the heatsink.

6. Install the heatsink on the PCB

    ![Heatsink installation](./resources/heatsink-install.png)

  - Flip the PCB so that the bottom is exposed.
  - Locate the large white square surrounding the exposed copper pad indicating
    the heatsink mounting location
  - Apply an even layer of thermal paste to the area.
  - Remove the paper backing from the tape on the heatsink to expose the adhesive surface
  - Press the heatsink into place on the PCB
  - Filp the PCB so the top is up and locate the three holes used to mount the
    heatsink to the PCB. Thead three self-tapping screws through a nylon washer
    and then into the heatsink itself. Hand tighten until the heat sink is
    firmly head against the back of the PCB. You should see thermal compount
    coming through the numerious vias in the PCB. This is disired because it
    provides a low thermal resistance path between the PCB and the heatsink.

6. Solder the power switch to the PCB.

    ![Power switch soldering](./resources/power-switch-solder.jpg)

  - Solder the power switch to the two indicated terminals on the PCB.
  - Make sure you do this __after__ you have installed the switch in the rear
    panel.
  - The wires can be soldered to either solder point, orientation does not
    matter since this is a SPST switch.

7. Install the front panel on the enclosure

    ![Front panel installation](./resources/front-panel-install.jpg)

  - Using 4 of the 11 self-trapping screws, install the front panel on the enclosure.
  - __Note:__ The orientation of the enclosure matters. The top of the
    enclosure is indicated by rows of decorative lines as indicated in the
    above figure.

8. Install the PCB in the enclosure.

    ![Front panel installation](./resources/pcb-install-steps.png)

  - Slide the PCB into the box using the __middle__ mounting rail.
  - __Note:__ The heatsink should be making firm contact with the bottom of
    the enclosure. If it is not, you should add thermal paste to the bottom of
    the heatsink to fill the gap. The heatsink must have a low thermal
    resistance path to the enclosure to dissipate heat during operation.
  - __Note:__ When the BNC connectors come through the front panel, you will
    need to push them down a bit, slightly flexing the PCB to get the panel mount controls through the front panel.

9. Install the rear panel.

  - Loop the two hook up wires and push them into the enclosure on top of the
    PCB.
  - Use the panel the push the remaining wire into the enclosure.
  - Use the remaining 4 screws to install the rear panel.

10. Install gain knob and button cover.

    ![Gain knob installation](./resources/gain-knob-install-steps.png)

  - Slip the toothed washer over the gain dial.
  - Tighten the jam nut on the gain dial's threads until just past finger tight
    using a pair of needle nose pliers.
  - __Note:__ Do not over-tighten using a combination spanner or you will
    strip the threads.
  - Turn the dial on the front panel _fully counter-clockwise_.
  - Slip the gain knob over the dial with the tick mark pointed slightly below
    the 0 position.
  - Tighten the set screw on the side of the knob to lock it into place using
    an Allen key.
  - When you turn the knob fully clockwise, the tick mark should be pointing
    close to the 1.5A position.
  - Press the red cover over the `TEST` switch until it snaps into place.

Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a high-precision, high-power,
high-speed LED driver that will make commercial drives feel a bit ridiculous
for costing so much and very self-conscious about their performance
characteristics. For further usage instructions, performance specs, theory of
operations, etc, etc, please refer to the complete manual located on the

### Construction of Photodiode1. Obtain the necessary materials  - Use ULP BOM trick listed earlier in the manual to get the complete bill of materials  - You will also need a lens cap (such as this one http://www.m12lenses.com/M12-Lens-Holder-Plastic-p/pt-lh001p.htm) to block out the surrounding light2. Assemble the board   - Using similar methods to assembling the Cyclops, use solder paste to put together the photodiode PCB. (Make sure you don’t miss the components on the back!)3. Bake the board using preferred method.4. Solder the BNC connector and the power header onto the board.5. Epoxy a SMA905 female to female connector directly onto the main photodiode. (We do this so that the fiber can be disconnected from the photodiode if need be)6. Put a small amount of opaque epoxy on the photodiode on the back.	Note: this secondary photodiode is a dark current compensator.  It essentially obtains a baseline signal from when there is no light going to the photodiode and this noise is then subtracted from the other PD signal.7. Connect the BNC Out port on the photodiode to the Aux In port on the cyclops.

# LED

There are several things to consider when determining the type of LED
you wish to drive with the Cyclops and the configuration of the LED.

- Will optical stimulation be used in-vivo or through a microscope?
- Will it be performed on freely behaving animals?
- Do you need to perform bilateral stimulation?
- Will you need to incorporate an amplified photodiode into your
  stimulator to measure optical power or use use optical feedback to
  produce ultra precise light waveforms?

The answers to these questions will determine the type of LED you use,
how it is coupled to the preparation (e.g. collimated for the back
aperture of your microscope or, fiber coupled for in-vivo stimulation),
and weather or not it needs to be commutated in some way. The following
provide a few simple options for LED configurations, but there are many
more to consider for your experiments.

![A simple 'pigtailed' LED module. A female SMA connector is cemented over a
lens-free high power LED to form a near optimal butt-coupling between the fiber
and the LED die.](./resources/fiber-coupled-led.png)

## Fiber-coupled LED

### DIY Solution
Anders Asp has contributed the following PDF document containing detailed
instructions for fabricating a bilateral, commutated fiber-coupled LED for use
in freely moving animals that works with the Cyclops driver:

connector](http://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2615&pn=CON8ML-4#5315)
in expansion port B to drive these LEDs. Solder the wires from the connector to
the cyclops PCB as shown in the following image __after__ you have
installed the connector into the rear panel of the device.

![Thorlabs LED M8 connector pinout](./resources/thorlabs-m8-connections.png)

### Doric LED fiber-coupled modules

The cyclops can be used to Drive [Doric fiber-coupled LED
modules](http://doriclenses.com/life-sciences/home/783-connectorized-single-led.html).
You will need to install the [M8 4-position
